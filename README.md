Hello! I'm Vitor Schwanke, a 25-year-old recent graduate with a degree in Business Analytics. I am passionate about turning data into actionable insights and have strong experience in tools like MySQL, Python (including NumPy, Sklearn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn), and Power BI. My analytical skills help me dive deep into data to uncover trends, patterns, and opportunities that drive business decisions. In this portfolio, you'll find a couple of different branches, projects (ipynb, pbix), where you'll find my project's downloadable archives, a datasets branch where you'll find the csv datasets, and also a reports branch, where you can discover Reports in Non-Technical language so all stakeholders can absorb the provided insights. 

Beyond my professional life, I love to travel, train, and spend time outdoors in nature, which fuels my curiosity and creativity. This portfolio showcases my journey in the data world and highlights some of the projects I've worked on. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect!
